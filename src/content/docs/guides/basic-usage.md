# Basic Usage Guide

This guide covers the fundamentals of working with our consultation services and how to get maximum value from every session.

## Before Your Consultation

### Defining Your Goals

Before booking a session, take time to clearly define what you want to achieve:

1. **Identify the problem** - What specific challenge are you facing?
2. **Set objectives** - What outcomes would make this session successful?
3. **Gather context** - What background information should we know?

### Preparing Materials

Depending on your consultation type, prepare relevant materials:

```plaintext
For Strategy Sessions:
- Business goals and constraints
- Current state assessment
- Timeline expectations

For Technical Support:
- Code repositories or samples
- Error messages or logs
- Environment details

For Code Reviews:
- Repository access
- Specific areas of concern
- Performance metrics (if applicable)
```

## During Your Consultation

### Making the Most of Your Time

- **Be specific** - The more specific your questions, the more actionable the answers
- **Take notes** - Document key insights and recommendations
- **Ask for clarification** - Don't hesitate to ask for more detail

### Communication Tips

- Share your screen when discussing code or architecture
- Use the chat for links and code snippets
- Record the session (with permission) for future reference

## After Your Consultation

### Follow-Up Actions

1. **Review your notes** within 24 hours while the discussion is fresh
2. **Create action items** based on recommendations
3. **Schedule follow-up** if needed for complex projects

## Best Practices

| Do                                    | Don't                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Come prepared with specific questions | Show up without context |
| Take notes during the session         | Rely on memory alone    |
| Ask for clarification when needed     | Assume you understand   |
| Follow up on action items             | Let recommendations sit |
